Typical workflow using virtualenv:

Created virtual environment:
virtualenv3.4 -p path-to-python3.4 venv

Activate virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate

Install packages:
pip install Flask
pip install TwitterSearch

Test locally:
foreman start
(uses Procfile to determine what to do. Point browser at 0.0.0.0:500 to see results)
